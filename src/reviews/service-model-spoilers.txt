What it does well: I love to read stories featuring viewpoints with fundamentally nonhuman perspectives. Uncharles' alien, protocol driven mindset fits this perfectly – his values and entire worldview are fundamentally different to any human mindset. I also liked how Tchaikovsky manages to weave dry humor through the entirety of the tale, highlighting the absurdities in their tragic, outrageous glory.

What it doesn't do well: The story as a whole is a somewhat blatant allegory for the present political climate (review written in May 2025).  This did break my immersion somewhat, even as someone who agreed with many of the points made. As a reader, I don't want to feel like I'm being preached at, I want to enjoy a story. Further, many of the parables, while philosophically rich, don't make a lot of sense. They are entertaining to contemplate but don't feel plausible in the context of the story. Finally, I personally gripe somewhat with the ending. After a long set of episodes reinforcing the massive societal decline and irreparable loss of knowledge, the ending implies both that Uncharles has essentially unlocked personhood, and that society is being mended. This felt uncharacteristically optimistic to me – if the whole story continually reinforced that our species makes our own doom, what has actually changed that we can get things right this time? How should we rebuild our civilization, with what differing values and methods should we apply, that things don't go wrong again? The ending did not feel plausible in the context of the rest of the story.
