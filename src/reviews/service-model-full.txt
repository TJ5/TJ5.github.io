Service Model is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel told from the perspective of a robotic valet that inexplicably murders his master. It's one part story and one part philosophical treatise, as the seemingly emotionless being navigates a shattered world looking for a purpose, or perhaps, more profoundly, a meaning.

Several core questions are presented to the reader â€“ Why did the protagonist, Uncharles, murder his master? What truly is the cause of the degeneration of society? And finally, is Uncharles actually sentient? Does he have choice, and free will? These questions, and the ramifications to their answers, are explored through episodic, philosophical parables as two characters, Uncharles and his human companion "The Wonk" explore the wasteland.

The central theme of the novel, touched on in every parable, is the way the humans engineered their own decay. While these nameless, featureless individuals, and the society that made them, are long gone, their legacy remains in the meaningless, endless entropic cycles their machines continue to spin in long after their demise. None of the robotic characters are capable of feeling emotion as a human would understand it. All crave a purpose, to be useful. That fulfilling these directives continues to contribute to the ongoing downfall of what civilization remains is immaterial to them. Several such examples are written, as Tchaikovsky argues through this that our species' wants are inherently self-destructive.
