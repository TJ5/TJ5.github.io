I enjoyed reading the book. Even taking into account my various criticisms, each parable was a joy to read, featuring suspense, mystery, thought-provoking ideas, and solid character work. For all that I disagree with some of the author's conclusions, Service Model introduced me to new ideas and made me think, which is really what science fiction is all about.
